# Basic-Job-Recommender-System
* *The problem statement for this project has been given by **BOONGG** ,a bike rental that will allow you to travel pocket-friendly &   freely visit each point in the city.*
* *It is an pre-interview task.*
* **Create a personalized job recommender system for a fictional company XYZ .Inc.**

* XYZ .Inc. is similar to naukri.com/indeed.com, where people upload their resumes and check what are the other jobs available to them.*

*The CEO of the company wants to take this further and wants to introduce a premium feature called
Personalized Job recommendation system.*

*The CEO has gathered some data ( around 466 Users ) and is looking for a candidate to build this recommender system.*

* *The dataset has provided by the company itself*


|Dataset                        |Some info about data                                                                                           |
|------------------------------ |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Job Listing Clicks by the user |<ul><li>userId(XYZ userId)</li><li>JobId (XYZ JobId)</li><li>Clicks(Number of times user has clicked)</li></ul>|
| Jobs                          |<ul> <li>JobId</li> <li>Job_category</li> </ul>                                                                |      

* *I have used jupyter notebook for this project and performed this using different libraries like Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn and also used Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn)which is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.*
* *We can deploy the model on webpage using flask(for backend),html,css,javascript(for frontend)*
* *Also, we can use **[Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)** (Streamlit is a software company offering an open-source platform for machine learning and data science teams to create data applications with python.The platform uses python scripting, APIs, widgets, instant deployment, team collaboration tools, and application management solutions to help data scientists and machine learning engineers create python-based applications. Applications created using Streamlit range from applications capable of real time object detection, geographic data browsers, deep dream network debuggers, to face-GAN explorers. Frameworks compatible with Streamlit include: Scikit Learn, Altair, Bokeh, latex,)*
