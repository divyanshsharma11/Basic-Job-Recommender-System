# Basic-Job-Recommender-System
* *The problem statement for this project has been given by **BOONGG** ,a bike rental that will allow you to travel pocket-friendly &   freely visit each point in the city.*
* *It is an pre-interview task.*
* **Create a personalized job recommender system for a fictional company XYZ .Inc.**

* XYZ .Inc. is similar to naukri.com/indeed.com, where people upload their resumes and check what are the other jobs available to them.*

*The CEO of the company wants to take this further and wants to introduce a premium feature called
Personalized Job recommendation system.*

*The CEO has gathered some data ( around 466 Users ) and is looking for a candidate to build this recommender system.*

* *The dataset has provided by the company itself*


|Dataset                        |Some info about data                                                                                           |
|------------------------------ |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Job Listing Clicks by the user |<ul><li>userId(XYZ userId)</li><li>JobId (XYZ JobId)</li><li>Clicks(Number of times user has clicked)</li></ul>|
| Jobs                          |<ul> <li>JobId</li> <li>Job_category</li> </ul>                                                                |      

* *I have used jupyter notebook for this project and performed this using different libraries like Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn and also used Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn)which is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.*
* *We can deploy the model on webpage using flask(for backend),for frontend(HTML,CSS,JavaScript).*

* *Also, we can use **[Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)** (Streamlit is a software company offering an open-source platform for machine learning and data science teams to create data applications with python..*

* *In this project the target variable is **"Job_category"** and there are 9 categories under this category and we predict it by giving value of userid,jobid and 
 the number of clicks by the user.*
* UserId and JobId are both unique.*
